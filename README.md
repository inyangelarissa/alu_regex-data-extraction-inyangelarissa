Regex Data Extraction Application 
Overview
This project was developed as part of the Regex Onboarding Hackathon at ALU. My app is a Python-based web application that extracts specific data types from large strings using Regular Expressions (Regex). The data is collected from multiple web sources, and the application accurately identifies and extracts information such as emails, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and HTML tags.
Features
The application extracts the following data types using custom-built regular expressions:
Email Addresses
URLs
Phone Numbers
Credit Card Numbers
HTML Tags
Hash Tags
Currencies
Time
Code Implementation
Python Functions
We implemented the extraction functions using Python's re
Comprehensive Regex Patterns: Includes a collection of regex patterns for common data extraction tasks.
Language Support: Examples in multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.).
Usage Examples: Detailed scripts and examples for various use cases.
Flexible and Extensible: The regex patterns can be adapted for different use cases as needed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.x (if you intend to run Python scripts)
Git (for cloning this repository)
A text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.
Installation
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
https://github.com/inyangelarissa/alu_regex-data-extraction-inyangelarissa
Navigate to the Project Directory
cd alu_regex-data-extraction-group1
(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment
If you plan to use Python for regex tasks, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
.\env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages (if any). For example:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Add a requirements.txt file if your project uses specific Python packages.
Usage
Running the Examples
The repository includes example scripts for different regex tasks. To run a script, use:
python <main>.py
